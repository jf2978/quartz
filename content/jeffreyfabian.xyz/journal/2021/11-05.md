sleeping in a little, sunny sweater weather (the best), having a stable profession (truly a privilege) #gratitude

# Writing
- what's [[My Superpower]]
- Reflecting on [[What I Value In An Employer]]

# Reading
- from Brian Armstrong's tweet: [[Peter Thiels CS183 Startup Class 18 Notes (Blake Masters)]]
    - interesting potential read found in that ^ rabbithole: [[Zero to One]]
    - also knew about this before and still want to do more research about it: [[Ocean Protocol]]

# Engineering
- cool idea that potentially combines my interests in handball (personal, athletic, NYC roots) x tech (website, merchandise store)
