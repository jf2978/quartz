crypto shenanigans (I'm a little addicted but it's fun!), being able to code (sometimes I forget I'm just writing color-coded words that affect tons of people), fresh air #gratitude

# Reading
- read the lawsuit summary of [[Terra vs. SEC]]
- found via LinkedIn outreach -> [[Rate Limiting Nullifier - A spam-protection mechanism for anonymous environments]]
- [[Ontological Humility]]
# Writing
- draft up a presentation for [[QB Convene]] ! I can totally help Questies with financial planning, mention [[Second Generation (Newsletter)]]
# Engineering
- {{[[DONE]]}} prep using [[SWE (Technical) Behavioral Interview]]
- Interesting idea that may be cool to share with range.co - is there a way to visualize availability by function/role/what someone can do? i.e. FE vs. BE engineering or separated them out based on knowledge silos ()
# Investing
- {{[[DONE]]}} update crypto entrypoints
