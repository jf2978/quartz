I was never much of a reader, but nowadays I don't think we have a choice.

We can't help but consume content -- the marvel of the internet is that it has made information *feel infinite* -- and the new problem we seem to face is *not* that we don't have enough time to consume everything, but rather that we've lost the necessary space to develop [[cognitive]] and [[emotional]] consonance.

So this is my attempt at making space. Space to [intentionally consume] the ever-growing forms of content, store my half-baked thoughts, and eventually [commit](writing/Why%20I%20Write.md) to ideas that resonate with me.
