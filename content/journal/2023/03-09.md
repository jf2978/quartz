# Gratitude

- being home -- both the feeling and a physical place -- after being away for a while
- great sleep

#  Priorities

### Health

> *Live with physical, emotional and psychological health in mind as it is foundational to a balanced, quality existence.*

- keep recovering from long snowboarding soreness & tiredness

### Creativity

> *Give myself the freedom to follow my curiosities, try new things and empower myself to create with no end goal in mind as it is, no matter how small, an expression of the soul — to take what would otherwise be a unique intellectual, emotional and imaginative conscious experience and share it with another.*

- tend to my quartz digital garden a bit
- make some progress on drop subscriptions! #bonfire


### Rich Relationships

>*Seek to incorporate an ethics of care:
> 
 "[As opposed to an] ethic of justice [that] focuses on questions of fairness, equality, individual rights, abstract principles and the consistent application of them. An ethic of care focuses on attentiveness, trust, responsiveness to need, narrative nuance and cultivating caring relations." (Carol Gilligan)*

- plan to catch up with close friends & family

### Success

> *Success is socially-derived and a practical need for cultural optionality — while it does not determine who we are or what we "ought" to value, it does determine the breadth of our influence on those around us.*

- start thinking about how to get my money right (and taxes, ugh)
