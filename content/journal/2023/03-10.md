# Gratitude
- good cup of morning coffee + pour over ritual
- my physical health
- exciting ideas that keep me up at night

#  Intentions

### Health

> *Live with physical, emotional and psychological health in mind as it is foundational to a balanced, quality existence.*

- take things slow
- wind down early enough to be in bed by 10

### Creativity

> *Give myself the freedom to follow my curiosities, try new things and empower myself to create with no end goal in mind as it is, no matter how small, an expression of the soul — to take what would otherwise be a unique intellectual, emotional and imaginative conscious experience and share it with another.*

### Rich Relationships

>*Seek to incorporate an ethics of care:
> 
 "[As opposed to an] ethic of justice [that] focuses on questions of fairness, equality, individual rights, abstract principles and the consistent application of them. An ethic of care focuses on attentiveness, trust, responsiveness to need, narrative nuance and cultivating caring relations." (Carol Gilligan)*

### Success

> *Success is socially-derived and a practical need for cultural optionality — while it does not determine who we are or what we "ought" to value, it does determine the breadth of our influence on those around us.*

- re-evaluate my financial goals for the year (quarterly check-in of sorts)
