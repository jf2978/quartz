#  Intentions

### Health

> *Live with physical, emotional and psychological health in mind as it is foundational to a balanced, quality existence.*

- Getting back into the swing of gym things -- light workout + sauna routine 

### Creativity

> *Give myself the freedom to follow my curiosities, try new things and empower myself to create with no end goal in mind as it is, no matter how small, an expression of the soul — to take what would otherwise be a unique intellectual, emotional and imaginative conscious experience and share it with another.*

- Work -> reminder to self: just because my work has an element of obligation / goal-oriented, doesn't mean it isn't also an expression of curiosity and an exercise of intellectual imagination
- Spend some time reading a book > "consuming content"

### Rich Relationships

>*Seek to incorporate an ethics of care:
> 
 "[As opposed to an] ethic of justice [that] focuses on questions of fairness, equality, individual rights, abstract principles and the consistent application of them. An ethic of care focuses on attentiveness, trust, responsiveness to need, narrative nuance and cultivating caring relations." (Carol Gilligan)*

- Love myself: show myself the grace I deserve rather than always opting to push myself
- Reach out to loved ones before I leave town for a few weeks:
	- Tech friends (BA, MG), & Fam (M&P, C) 

### Success

> *Success is socially-derived and a practical need for cultural optionality — while it does not determine who we are or what we "ought" to value, it does determine the breadth of our influence on those around us.*

- Try my best (work) + spend some time focusing on money goals

# Wind Down

- lots of "todos" floating around my headpsace right now -- while they do feel urgent / necessary, I'm writing it here to remind myself of what's *important*. 

My career and curiosities undoubtedly excite me, but there will always be work. My hopes, goals, and dreams lift me up when days are inexplicable and unpredictable (re: natural and chaotic), but dream too much and I'm simply not living.
