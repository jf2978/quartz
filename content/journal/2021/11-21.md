sunday mornings, low(er) ETH gas fees, sleeping like a baby #gratitude
# Reading

# Writing
- breaking down companies I'm actually interested in interviewing for
    - [[Range]]
    - [[Substack]]
    - [[Plaid]]
    - [[Bloomberg]] (referral)
    - [[Webflow]]

# Engineering
- {{[[TODO]]}} schedule technical R1 interview
- Start [[Technical Interview]] prep (I hate the game, but I gotta play it for now)

# Investing
- used bridge.terra.money for the first time -- pretty dope, low-ish fees
- want to stake LUNA/UST, but also wanna give some deeper thought into [[Choosing a Terra Validator]] to make sure I'm not either doing something stupid or blindly contributing to something I don't want to support w/ my capital
