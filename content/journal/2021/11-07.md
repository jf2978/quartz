daylight savings extra hour, sunny day, cool tech stuff ([[DeFi ]] lending is pretty dope) #gratitude

# Reading
- finish reading + notes on [[Reserve Whitepaper v1]]
- watch [[Reserve]] overview of new tokenomics
- stumbled on an interesting somewhat-unbiased take on "cancel culture": [[What is Cancel Culture (Aja Romano)]]
    - read it from start to end, but didn't get the chance to follow interesting rabbitholes + take notes (no time for that today); probably worth revisiting at some later point

# Writing
- update my [[Resume]] before the start of the work week
- [[Superfluid]] deep dive to better understand their value prop, how I can contribute, etc.

# Engineering
    - found [JSON Resume](https://github.com/jsonresume) and I think it's pretty dope -- easy to version control, clean, simple, markdown, etc.
    - maybe start infra things for my [[Personal Website]]
